# arras.io-leaderboard-bot
An arras.io bot that can scan servers and send leaderboards to discord.

Modify the bot_config.txt file to configure it to your needs. If you have a working proxy, you can add it to the proxy= line. If not, do not delete this line but simply leave the line as "proxy=".

To run, simply install the undici with npm and run the bot_loader.js file.
